## Overview
The Image IP Grabber project is a simple demonstration of how an image file can be used to log visitors' IP addresses when accessed through a web server. It includes an index.php file that logs visitors' IP addresses and serves an image file, along with a .htaccess file for URL rewriting.

**üõà Note:** ```This project utilizes PHP for server-side scripting and Apache's mod_rewrite module for URL rewriting.```

## Usage
- The `index.php` file logs visitors' IP addresses when accessed through the web server.
- Accessing the `index.php` file with the filename `meow.jpg` will serve the `cute_cat.png` image file and log the visitor's IP address.
- Accessing the `index.php` file with the filename `ip_logs.txt` and the correct password query parameter (`?p=mypassword123`) will serve the IP log file.
